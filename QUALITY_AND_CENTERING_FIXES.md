# Image Quality & Zoom Centering Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Image Quality Preservation**
**Problem**: The auto-fit functionality was re-drawing images to a canvas, which could degrade quality.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `autoFitTemplate()` to preserve the original image
- Only the `modifiedBackground` canvas is scaled for editing overlay
- The `backgroundImage` retains original quality
- `redraw()` function uses proper scaling parameters

### 2. **Zoom Centering Issues**
**Problem**: Image was shifting from center to left during zoom operations.

**Solution**:
- Simplified centering logic to work with existing CSS flexbox
- Removed conflicting positioning styles
- Ensured consistent flexbox behavior
- Better separation between centering and overflow states

## Technical Changes

### Auto-Fit Quality Preservation
```javascript
// Before: Created scaled image (quality loss)
backgroundImage.src = scaledCanvas.toDataURL(); 

// After: Preserve original image
backgroundImage = originalImage; // Keep original quality
modifiedBackground.drawImage(originalImage, 0, 0, optimal.width, optimal.height);
```

### Improved Centering Logic
```javascript
// Simplified centering - works with existing CSS
function centerContentInWorkspace(workspace, container) {
    workspace.style.justifyContent = 'center';
    workspace.style.alignItems = 'center';
    workspace.style.overflow = 'hidden';
    
    // Let CSS flexbox handle the positioning
    container.style.position = 'static';
    container.style.margin = '0';
}
```

### Redraw Quality Enhancement
```javascript
// Enhanced redraw with proper scaling
if (backgroundImage) {
    ctx.drawImage(backgroundImage, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
}
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Image Quality**
- Original image quality is preserved
- No unnecessary re-encoding or data loss
- Crisp display at all zoom levels
- High-quality output for certificate generation

### ✅ **Consistent Centering**
- Canvas stays properly centered during zoom operations
- Smooth transitions between center and overflow states
- No more left-shifting during zoom
- Predictable layout behavior

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- Reduced image processing overhead
- Faster template loading
- More efficient memory usage
- Smoother zoom operations

## Usage Notes

- **Template Upload**: Quality is automatically preserved during auto-fit
- **Zoom Operations**: Content stays properly centered until overflow
- **Large Templates**: Smoothly transition to scrollable view when needed
- **Small Templates**: Always remain centered in workspace

## Validation

To test the fixes:

1. **Quality Test**: Upload a high-resolution template and zoom in - text should remain crisp
2. **Centering Test**: Upload any template and zoom in/out - should stay centered until overflow
3. **Large Template Test**: Upload oversized template - should auto-fit and stay centered at 100%
4. **Scroll Test**: Zoom beyond workspace size - should smoothly transition to scrollable view

The system now provides high-quality image handling with consistent, predictable centering behavior.
